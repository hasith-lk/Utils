When cursor search for existance of a record it is necessary to stop on first hit. By Applying the row number we can limit the fetch and imporve performances.

-- Old code
   CURSOR exist_control IS
      SELECT 1
      FROM WORK_TIME_COUNTER_DESC_TAB
      WHERE (work_time_ > start_time AND work_time_ <= end_time)
      AND calendar_id = calendar_id_;


-- New Code
   -- Bug 146893, Added rownum to improve fetch performances
   CURSOR exist_control IS
      SELECT 1
      FROM WORK_TIME_COUNTER_DESC_TAB
      WHERE (work_time_ > start_time AND work_time_ <= end_time)
      AND calendar_id = calendar_id_
      AND rownum = 1;
