<P>This is a release of the IFS Applications component Sales Configurator 
(SCONF). <BR>For information regarding new functionality in this component 
version, refer to the documents located in the PRODDistribution/nobuild 
directory. <BR>For general technical information see the PRODDistribution 
release notes. </P><STRONG>

<P>General</P></STRONG>
<P>Changes in this release: 
<UL>
  <LI>Both the Sales Configurator &amp; Sales Configurator Workshop have been 
  modified to work with the Unicode character set. Data stored in a Unicode 
  enabled Oracle database can be viewed regardless of the input language and 
  script used to enter the data. In other words, the Sales Configurator &amp; 
  Workshop are true Unicode applications. 
  <LI>Oracle's ODBC driver is now used to connect to the database, since 
  Microsoft's ODBC driver (which was previously used) does not handle Unicode. 
  The login dialog in the Workshop has been changed to only display data sources 
  using Oracle's driver. The version of the driver must be at least 10.2.x, 
  otherwise a warning message will appear when connecting to the database. 
  <LI>The entire code base is upgraded to Visual Studio .NET 2003. 
  <LI>Building the installation project no longer requires InstallShield 
  Professional 6.3. The entire build process is managed from Visual Studio .NET 
  2003. 
  <LI>.NET framework is required to run the Workshop application. 
  <LI>The changes made for Unicode required that the old password system was 
  re-written. This means that passwords used for profiles defined in the Sales 
  Configurator Workshop must be re-entered and saved to disk. 
  <LI>The following tasks which were previously a part of the release, have been 
  made obsolete and are a no longer required: <I>_AgreementExtract</I>, 
  <I>_CustInfoExtract</I>, <I>Reload Customer</I> and <I>_TermsExtract</I>. 
</LI></UL>
<P>Regarding technical notes, restrictions and technical configuration, please 
refer to the Configuration Guide on the web.</P><STRONG>

<P>Setup programs for these tools are found in the Win32Client folder.</P><B>
<P>Note! </B>It is important to do complete installations. Installing parts of 
the IFS Sales Configurator Server or installing the server without installing 
the IFS Sales Configurator will result in Oracle errors when using associated 
functionality in IFS Applications.</P>
<P>The installation instructions provided in the "getting started" user manuals 
do not correctly describe the installation process. When installing IFS Sales 
Configurator, always follow the instructions in these release notes instead.</P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The IFS Sales Configurator Server is built using the 
standard IFS/Configuration Builder (ConfigBuild.exe). The

the IFS/Configuration Builder and deployed with Setup.exe (from Foundation1) or 
run manually.</FONT></P><STRONG>

<P>The server part of the component can be installed either from the IFS Base 
Server Administrator or by creating an install template in the IFS Configuration 
Builder tool. The install template should be started from SQL*Plus to begin the 
installation. IFS R&amp;D recommends use of SQL*Plus with the install 
template.</P>

<P>Upgrade Remarks</P></STRONG>
<P>Note! This version only supports upgrades from version 8.1.0 or later. 
Upgrades from earlier versions must be done in two steps - an upgrade to version 
8.1.0, followed by the upgrade to this version.</P>
<P>It is necessary to upgrade from an existing client installation. Previous 
versions of the Sales Configurator and Sales Configurator Workshop clients must 
be uninstalled before the new versions are installed. In addition, the 
SCONF_WORKSHOP role can simplify grants to users.</P>
<P>When upgrading from a previous release of the Sales Configurator, the data 
versions that were generated by the previous release of Sales Configurator 
Workshop must be re-generated. The Sales Configurator will present an error 
message if an attempt is made to open a data version created by a previous 
release of the Sales Configurator.</P>

<P>Limitations/Special Instructions</P></STRONG>
<P>None.</P>
<H3><A name="Getting Started">Getting Started</A></H3>
<P>Verify that there are no invalid objects in the database.<BR>Note! When using 
install template (created by IFS Configuration Builder), the installation ends 
with an automatic recompilation of all invalid objects.</P>
<P>Provided that installation has been performed according to the instructions 
above, it should be possible to start using both the Sales Configurator and 
Sales Configurator Workshop immediately. The Sales Configurator will be launched 
automatically as a background process from the standard IFS Applications clients 
when needed (e.g. when creating a Customer Order using a configurable sales 
part).</P>
<P>For more information on how to get going with the Sales Configurator 
Workshop, please refer to the "IFS Sales Configurator Workshop Getting Started" 
manual included in this release.</P>
<P dir=ltr>To use the Sales Configurator as a standalone application and 
transfer configurations into IFS Applications, IFS Connectivity must be 
configured to receive an ORDERS message. Refer to the documentation in IFS 
Applications. Also, the Internet Transaction Services (ITS) component must be 
installed.<BR><BR><STRONG><A name=Files>Files</A></P>
